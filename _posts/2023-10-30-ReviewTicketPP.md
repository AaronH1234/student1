## Review ticket
- I added the welcome on the Home page
- I added the intro on the Home page
- I added the code that people can press enter to send the code
- I added a scroll bar so if there is more message, the chat box wont change the size and will kkep the old message
- I fixed the the scorll bar problem, so everytime when sending message, the scorll bar will be at the bottom
