## Team Issue
- We were planing about how to do our project, but Eshaan wasn't here and it's really hard for us to get the final result because Eshaan is the Scrum Master of our team and is really important.

- One of our big issue is that we don't really have time because Eshaan is sick for few days.

## Individual Issue(s)
- When I am doing the Program Design and Development, I want to add some list code in it, but it didn't really works out.
